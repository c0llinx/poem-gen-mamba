# Machine Learning - PyTorch (CPU version) and Transformers
# Using a recent stable PyTorch version for CPU.
# If you have a specific reason for 2.7.0 and can ensure a CPU install, adjust.
# For Streamlit Cloud, explicitly asking for CPU is best for PyTorch if it defaults to CUDA.
# However, often just "torch" works and pip on a CPU machine picks the CPU version.
# Let's try a version known for good CPU wheel availability on Linux for Py3.9.
torch==2.3.1
transformers==4.41.2 # A recent stable version
sentencepiece # For tokenization, hopefully a wheel exists for Python 3.9
accelerate # Often helpful for Transformers, even on CPU

# Mamba specific packages
mamba-ssm # Let pip try to find the latest compatible version for Py3.9/Torch2.3.1
causal-conv1d>=1.1.0 # Dependency for mamba-ssm

# For Google Drive downloads and web requests
requests
charset-normalizer # To resolve the requests warning

# Common and important dependencies (sometimes good to pin)
protobuf~=3.20 # protobuf 3.20.x is widely compatible
# altair==5.5.0 # Streamlit uses this, pip should get it
# numpy # torch/transformers will pull this
# pandas # streamlit will pull this
# huggingface-hub # transformers will pull this
# safetensors # transformers will pull this
