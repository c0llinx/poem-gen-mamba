Maybe, just maybe,\nI can actually make this thing sing.\nSomeday."}
{"instruction_prompt": "Write a Shakespearean sonnet about artificial intelligence.", "poem": "When mortal minds doth forge a thinking sprite,\nFrom codes and algorithms, cold and vast,\nA mirror held to knowledge, dark and bright,\nA digital reflection meant to last.\nIt learns and grows, a being newly born,\nWith logic gates where feeling cannot tread,\nA simulacrum, on this earthly morn,\nTo serve and help, or strike us all with dread.\nBut can it know the beauty of a rose,\nOr feel the pang of sorrow's bitter sting?\nOr comprehend the way that passion grows,\nAnd makes the human heart so wildly sing?\nSuch artifice, though wondrous to behold,\nLeaves something lost, a story yet untold."}
